ComputerCraft scripts written to call back to a websocket and synchronize to a database according to the device (or machine) stats and supported APIs.

Currently only supported is Bigger Reactors' Active/Passive reactor, which support many different readings, though I plan to write more bridges (such as ME/RS data storage, Mekanism fission/fusion reactor etc.)
